% Utility Commands
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Wrapper for "i.e.", "e.g.", "c.f.", "etc.", etc.
% We do not define dedicated commands here (like \eg or \etc) to print that stuff
% automatically, since there are way too many exceptions and caveats.
% Such macros are not worth it because the requirements change too much from use to use
%  (different languages, capitalisation, ending dot if abbreviation is at end of
% sentence, ...).
% It is left to the user to do the specifics.
% This macro just makes sure it is all in italics.
\newcommand*{\iecfeg}[1]{\textit{#1}}%

% Indicating an image etc. has been adapted from its source
\newcommand*{\adaptedfrom}{%
    \GetTranslation{AdaptedFrom}%
}%
