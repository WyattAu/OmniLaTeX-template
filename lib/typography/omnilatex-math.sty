% Allow multi-line environments to break across pages.

% [1]: allow pagebreaks, but avoid as much as possible.
% [4]: maximum permissiveness

% Using the starred variant of the created command (like \parens*{<content>})
% also scales the delimiters automatically, using \left and \right.

% Glossary Integration Wrappers
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Create a couple of wrappers to integrate with gls
% These are only necessary because we cannot really create gls entries that also accept
% arguments, so we treat them separately.
%
% Use the \<XYZ>fmt commands only to format arguments, without doing anything else.
% Then use the \<XYZ> commands in the text, which includes indexing etc.
% We use \glsdisp, which works like \glsdisp{<indexed label>}{<displayed link text>}
% and respects the first use flag.
% If {<displayed link text>} contains another glossary-entry, e.g. a \sym command,
% that is still indexed and seems to work. The link leads to <indexed label>.
%
% If the custom commands do not make use of gls-like commands explicitly,
% add a \glsadd to create an entry in the glossary, but no text at the location

% use dottedsquare (provided by unicode-math package, refer to unimath-symbols.pdf)
% as a placeholder for symbols
% HACKY: Raise it a bit, since default symbol hangs low

% Usage example 2: \deriv{x} -> derivative of x
% Usage example 3: \deriv*{x} -> partial derivative of x
% Usage example 4: \deriv[5]{x} -> 5th derivative of x
%
% \newcommand syntax:
% \newcommand{<command>}[<number of arguments>][<defaults>]{<code>}
%
% I.e., if [<defaults>] is empty, no default values exist.
% If one optional argument exists, it takes #1, and the mandatory arguments are appended
% as #2, ...
%
% Use explicit glssymbol, since the regular field 'name' is occupied by what will be
% printed in the glossary (with the \symbolplaceholder appended)
