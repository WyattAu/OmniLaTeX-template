    The following styles do not contain page lists of the entries' occurrences,
    leading to a cleaner, more concise look.
    Refer to the source code on how to achieve this (which options and styles to use).

    % If `nonumberlist` is passed, the `long3colheader` style simply leaves the
    % corresponding table cells *empty* (leading to an entirely empty column), but does
    % not actually remove the column. So use a different, but equivalent style
    % altogether:
    style=longheader,
    % The `longheader` style prints the page list behind the description, just not in a
    % separate column. So also explicitly suppress the generation of that:
