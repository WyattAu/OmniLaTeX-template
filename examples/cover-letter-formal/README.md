# OmniLaTeX Formal Academic Cover Letter Example

This example demonstrates how to create a formal academic cover letter using the OmniLaTeX document class, suitable for academic positions such as faculty, research, or administrative roles.

## Usage

1. Customize the placeholders in `config/document-settings.sty` with your personal and institutional information, recipient details, and position information.
2. Edit the content in `main.tex` to tailor the letter to the specific academic position, highlighting your research, teaching experience, and fit for the institution.
3. Compile with `latexmk -lualatex main.tex` to render the formal academic cover letter.

## Configuration

The `config/document-settings.sty` file contains placeholders for:
- Sender information (name, academic address, contact details)
- Recipient information (name, institution, department address)
- Position and academic details

Replace all bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[YOUR NAME]`) with actual information before compiling.

## Content Structure

The formal academic cover letter follows a standard academic application format:
- Formal salutation addressing the recipient by name and title
- Introduction stating the position and how you learned about it
- Body highlighting research accomplishments, publications, teaching experience, and relevant qualifications
- Expression of interest in the institution and department
- Mention of enclosed documents (CV, research statement, teaching philosophy, recommendation letters)
- Closing expressing enthusiasm and contact information
- Professional academic sign-off with title and affiliation

## Key Differences from Standard Cover Letter

This formal academic version includes:
- More detailed research and publication information
- Teaching experience and mentoring details
- Academic-specific language and structure
- References to enclosed academic documents
- Professional title and institutional affiliation in the signature
