# OmniLaTeX Cover Letter Example

This example demonstrates how to create a professional cover letter using the OmniLaTeX document class.

## Usage

1. Customize the placeholders in `config/document-settings.sty` with your personal information, recipient details, and position information.
2. Edit the content in `main.tex` to tailor the letter to the specific job and company.
3. Compile with `latexmk -lualatex main.tex` to render the cover letter.

## Configuration

The `config/document-settings.sty` file contains placeholders for:
- Sender information (name, address, contact details)
- Recipient information (name, company, address)
- Position and company details

Replace all bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[YOUR NAME]`) with actual information before compiling.

## Content Structure

The cover letter follows a standard professional format:
- Salutation
- Introduction expressing interest
- Body highlighting relevant experience and skills
- Closing expressing enthusiasm for the opportunity
- Professional sign-off
